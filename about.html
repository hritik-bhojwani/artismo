                Amit Trivedi (born 8 April 1979) is an Indian music director, singer and a lyricist. As a contemporary music director, he is well known for his versatility. Amit's work ranges from angry rock, authentic classical, honey-soaked melodies to novel fusion music.[1] After working as a theatre and jingle composer and composing for non-film albums, he debuted as a film composer in the 2008 Hindi film Aamir,[2] and was noticed for his critically acclaimed work in the Hindi film Dev.D (2009),[3][4] which earned him several awards, including the 2010 National Film Award for Best Music Direction.

            <p>In his younger days, an electronic musical instrument fascinated Trivedi and he was slowly drawn towards music, mainly influenced by classical music. At 19â€“20, he began composing music. In college days, he joined the band Om, who performed at local gigs, small shows and live performances. They struck gold when Times Music took notice at one of their shows, and offered to launch their album. The album however did not fare well, due to lack of promotion.[8] Eventually Trivedi went on to compose for theatre (Hindi, English and Gujarati plays), background music for television shows, programming for some Marathi films, live performances, dandiya shows, orchestras etc. He also had a brief stint composing advertisement jingles, for brands such as McDonald's and Airtel.[9] After sound engineer and Audio Garage Recording Studio owner Arvind Vishwakarma introduced Trivedi to Sony BMG, he began composing music for non-film albums. As a part of his two-year contract, Trivedi composed some tracks for Abhijeet Sawant's Junoon and one song in Prashant Tamang's debut album. He arranged for many musicians including Amartya Rahut for a Marathi film Uttarayan in 2004. </p>
